## Introduction

In this repository, we provide the code for *"A Comparative Study on Generative Models for High Resolution Extreme Ultraviolet Solar Images"* ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07169)).

## Obtaining solar (SDO) data

The dataset is available here: <https://huggingface.co/datasets/slampai/solar-sdo>.
Download it and unzip using:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/slampai/solar-sdo/raw/main/image_folder_1024x1024_normalized_log_transform_193A_40K_with_lev1.5_corrections.zip
unzip image_folder_1024x1024_normalized_log_transform_193A_40K_with_lev1.5_corrections.zip
```

## Downloading models

### (Best) Diffusion model

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/slampai/generative-models-for-highres-solar-images/resolve/main/diffusion/diffusion_1000t_lr0.0001_128ch_2bpr_horiz_flip/ema_0.9999_058000.pt --output-document=ema_0.9999_058000.pt
```

The full set of models is available at <https://huggingface.co/slampai/generative-models-for-highres-solar-images/tree/main/models/diffusion>.

### (Best) ProjectedGAN model

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/slampai/generative-models-for-highres-solar-images/resolve/main/models/projgan/00017-stylegan2-proj_baseline/network-snapshot.pkl --output-document=projgan_best.pkl
```
The full set of models is available at <https://huggingface.co/slampai/generative-models-for-highres-solar-images/tree/main/models/projgan>.
